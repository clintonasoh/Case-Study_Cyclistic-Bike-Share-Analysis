# Cyclistic Bike-Share Analysis Documentation

## Background

Cyclistic, a bike-share company based in Chicago, launched its successful bike-share offering in 2016. Over the years, the program has grown significantly, boasting a fleet of 5,824 bicycles spread across 692 stations in Chicago. Cyclistic bikes can be unlocked from one station and returned to any other station in the system, offering users flexibility in their mobility choices. The company's marketing strategy initially focused on building general awareness and attracting broad consumer segments by offering flexible pricing plans, including single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships.

Cyclistic's finance analysts have determined that annual members are substantially more profitable than casual riders. With this insight, the director of marketing, Moreno, believes that maximizing the number of annual members is crucial for the company's future growth. To achieve this goal, the marketing team aims to convert casual riders into annual members by understanding the differences between these two customer segments, identifying why casual riders might opt for a membership, and exploring how digital media can influence marketing tactics.

## Business Task

The primary business task is to analyze Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to identify trends and insights that will inform the development of a marketing strategy aimed at converting casual riders into annual members. By understanding the behavior and preferences of different customer segments, the marketing team intends to design targeted campaigns to attract more annual memberships.

## Datasets

The analysis utilizes Cyclistic's historical trip data covering the last 12 months (April 2021 - March 2022). These datasets contain information about bike trips, including the type of rider (casual or annual member), ride duration, start and end station details, and bike type. The data is publicly available and provided by Motivate International Inc.

## Data Collection and Preparation

The data collection process involves loading individual CSV files containing trip data for each month and merging them into a single dataset. Various data cleaning and manipulation techniques are employed to ensure data quality and consistency. These steps include adding columns to extract date-related information, calculating ride durations, removing irrelevant data entries, handling missing values, and identifying and eliminating duplicates.

## Descriptive Analysis

Descriptive analysis is performed to gain insights into ride patterns, duration, and bike usage by different user types (casual riders vs. annual members). Key findings from the descriptive analysis include average ride durations, comparison of ride counts between user types, analysis of rides by day of the week, and visualization of ride counts and durations by user type and bike type.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, several recommendations are proposed to convert more casual riders into annual members. These recommendations include creating promotional offers for weekends, incentivizing longer rides with subscription discounts, and targeting docked bike users with membership campaigns. These strategies aim to capitalize on observed trends and behaviors identified in the data analysis to attract more annual memberships.

## Dataset Limitation

A significant limitation of the dataset is the presence of missing values, which can impact the accuracy of the analysis and conclusions drawn from it. The documentation emphasizes the importance of addressing this limitation and acknowledges the potential impact on the validity of the findings.

## Conclusion

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the data analysis process, key findings, and recommendations for Cyclistic's marketing strategy. By leveraging insights from historical trip data, the marketing team can devise targeted campaigns to achieve the goal of increasing annual memberships and driving future growth for the company.
